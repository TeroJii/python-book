# Data visualisation with Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a comprehensive plotting library for Python. It can be used to create a wide variety of plots, including line plots, bar plots, histograms, scatter plots, and much more. Matplotlib is highly customizable and allows you to create publication-quality plots. Matplotlib can be installed using pip or conda:

```bash
# installation using pip
pip install matplotlib
```

## Getting started

Let's start by creating a simple line plot using Matplotlib. The following code generates a sine wave and plots it using Matplotlib. We start by importing the necessary libraries.

```{python}
#| code-fold: false
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```

Next, we generate the data for the sine wave and plot it using Matplotlib.

```{python}
#| code-fold: false
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = np.sin(x)
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.show()
```

The `plt.plot()` function is used to create the plot, and the `plt.show()` function is used to display the plot. The `x` and `y` arrays contain the data for the x-axis and y-axis, respectively. Essentially, we were able to create a decent looking plot with just four lines of code.
