# Functions

You might have noticed, but we have been using built-in functions in the previous chapters already. Python comes with a number of functions that are ready to be used. And in case you want to build your own, that is also possible. 

## Built-in functions

Python has a number of built-in functions that are always available. Here are a few examples (some of which we've already encountered):

- `print()`: prints the given argument(s) to the console
- `type()`: returns the type of the given argument
- `len()`: returns the length of the given argument

## User-defined functions

Custom-made functions are a way to encapsulate code that you want to reuse. They are defined using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name, a list of parameters in parentheses, and a colon. The function body is then indented.

## Lambda expressions
