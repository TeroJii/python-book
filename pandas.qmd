# Pandas

Pandas is Python library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures like Series and DataFrame that are designed to work with structured data very easily and efficiently. It is built on top of NumPy. You can install pandas using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

## Series

Series is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type (integers, strings, floating point numbers, Python objects, etc.). The axis labels are collectively referred to as the index. The basic method to create a Series is to call the series constructor:

```{python}
#| code-fold: false
# import numpy and pandas libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# create a series from a list
pd.Series(data = [1, 2, 3, 4])
```
