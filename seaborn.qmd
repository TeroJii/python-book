# Seaborn for data visualisation

Seaborn is a Python data visualisation library based on Matplotlib. Seaborn makes it easy to create attractive and well-laid-out plots. Seaborn also plays nicely with Pandas data structures, which is important for data science related visualizations. We can install Seaborn easily using pip or conda:

```bash
# installation using pip
pip install seaborn
```

## Getting started

Let's start by creating a simple scatter plot using Seaborn. We start by importing the necessary libraries.

```{python}
#| code-fold: false
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
```

Next, we generate some random data and plot it using Seaborn (@fig-scatter1).

```{python}
#| code-fold: false
#| label: fig-scatter1
#| fig-cap: Scatter plot created using Seaborn.

x = np.random.normal(size=100)
y = np.random.normal(size=100)
df = pd.DataFrame({'x': x, 'y': y})

sns.scatterplot(x='x', y='y', data=df)
```

We can see right away that Seaborn's syntax differs somewhat from the one used by Matplotlib.
