# NumPy

So far we have only used commands that come with the standard Python distribution. However, Python is a very popular language for scientific computing and there are many packages that can be used to extend its capabilities. One of the most fundamental packages for extending Pythons capabilities for scientific computing is NumPy. NumPy is the cornerstone for many packages which are important data analysis, including but not limited to Pandas, SciPy, and Matplotlib.

## Installation and Loading

You can install python packages using the `pip` command. Another popular package manager is `conda`. Either of these package managers will do the trick.

Once you have installed the NumPy package, you can load it using the following command.

```{python}
#| code-fold: false
import numpy as np
```

Using NumPy to generate random numbers.

```{python}
