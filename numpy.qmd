# NumPy

So far we have only used commands that come with the standard Python distribution. However, Python is a very popular language for scientific computing and there are many packages that can be used to extend its capabilities. One of the most fundamental packages for extending Pythons capabilities in this domain is NumPy. NumPy is also the cornerstone for many packages which are important for doing data analysis with Python, including but not limited to Pandas, SciPy, and Matplotlib.

## Installation and Loading

You can install Python packages using the `pip` command. Another popular package manager is `conda`. Either of these package managers will do the trick.

Installing NumPy using pip in rather simple. Just run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
pip install numpy
```	
:::

Once you have installed the NumPy package, you can load it using the following command.

```{python}
#| code-fold: false
import numpy as np
```

We have imported the NumPy package and aliased it as `np`. This is a common convention when working with NumPy. We can now use the functions and classes provided by NumPy by prefixing them with `np.`. For example, generating a random number using NumPy would look like this:

```{python}
#| code-fold: false
np.random.rand(5)
```

## What can NumPy do?

One of the key concepts in NumPy are array and matrix data structures. Moreover, Numpy provides tools for working with these structures. The array is in principle quite similar to a list in Python, with a few key differences:

* Arrays can be multidimensional
* Arrays can only contain elements of the same type, whereas lists can contain elements of different types
* Arrays are optimized for numerical operations, whereas lists are not. This makes arrays much faster for numerical operations than lists, and also more memory efficient.

## NumPy Arrays

### 1-D Vectors

You can create a 1-D NumPy array from a list using the `np.array()` function. For example:

```{python}
#| code-fold: false
a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(a)
```

You might have noticed that we actually used a list to create the NumPy array. We can naturally create a NumPy array from a list which has been assigned to a variable. For example, below we will cast a list to an array using the variable `my_list`:

```{python}
#| code-fold: false

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
a = np.array(my_list)
print(a)
```

We can also create a NumPy array from a range of numbers using the `np.arange()` function. For example:

```{python}
#| code-fold: false
a = np.arange(1, 6)
print(a)
```

### 2-D Matrices

You can create a 2-D NumPy array from a list of lists using the `np.array()` function. For example:

```{python}
#| code-fold: false
b = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
print(b)
```
