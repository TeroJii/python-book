# Introduction

Python is an object-oriented, easy-to-use, high-level, general-purpose programming language. I've heard people say:

> Python is the second best language for everything.

which really is a testament on how versatile the language really is. Let's take a look at some of the basics of the language before diving in deeper.

## Basic Data Types

Numbers, strings and booleans are some of the most basic data types found in Python.

### Working with numbers

Numbers can be categorized into integers and floats, depending on the use of a decimal point. Both can be used for performing basic arithmetics as shown below:

```{python}
#| code-fold: false
1 + 1
```

```{python}	
#| code-fold: false
1.0 + 2.5
```
