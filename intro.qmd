# Introduction

Python is an object-oriented, easy-to-use, high-level, general-purpose programming language. There is a popular saying in the programming community along the lines of:

> Python is the second best language for everything.

which really is a testament on how versatile the language really is. Let's take a look at some of the basics of the language before diving in deeper.

## Basic Data Types

Numbers, strings and booleans are some of the most basic data types found in Python.

### Working with numbers

Numbers can be categorized into integers and floats, depending on the use of a decimal point. Both can be used for performing basic arithmetics as shown below:

```{python}
#| code-fold: false
1 + 1
```

```{python}	
#| code-fold: false
1.0 + 2.5
```

This as such is not super useful. However, we can assing numbers (as well as other data types) into variables, which will help us store and manipulate data:

```{python}
#| code-fold: false
my_iq = 259

print(my_iq)
```



### Strings

Strings are used to represent text data. They can be enclosed in either single `'` or double `"` quotes.
Some basic operations on strings include concatenation and repetition:

```{python}
#| code-fold: false
"Hello" + " " + "World"
```

```{python}
#| code-fold: false
"Hello" * 3
```

Strings can also be indexed and sliced:

```{python}
#| code-fold: false
my_string = "Hello World"

# indexing
print(my_string[0])
```

```{python}
#| code-fold: false
# slicing
print(my_string[0:5])
```



### Booleans

Booleans are used to represent truth values, namely `True` and `False`. They can be used in conjunction with logical operators such as `and`, `or` and `not`:

```{python}
#| code-fold: false
True and False
```
