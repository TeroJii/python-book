# Linear regression

Linear regression is fancy way of describing the act of fitting a line through your data. What makes it powerful is it's simplicity. When we are facing a regression problem this is usually the first thing we should try before moving on to more complex models. If you are looking for a detailed explanation on the intricacies of linear regression, I recommend checking out the wonderful book by James, Witten, Hastie and Tibshirani titled `An Introduction to Statistical Learning` (@ISLP).


```{python}
import seaborn as sns

iris = sns.load_dataset('iris')
iris.head()
```
